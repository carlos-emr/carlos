# `common/` — shared migrations

`V1__baseline_schema.sql` is the province-neutral schema baseline (structure only) — the tables
identical across Ontario and BC. It is the frozen genesis of the CARLOS schema (see `../README.md`).

Applied together with the selected province (`common` + `on`, or `common` + `bc`). Put **genuinely
shared future schema changes** here as `V1.0.N__short_description.sql` (sequential, next free version number) so one migration
covers both provinces.
