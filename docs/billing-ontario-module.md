## 1 — At a glance

The Ontario billing module captures, persists, corrects, and submits OHIP
claims for Ontario-resident patients. It implements:

- **Bill entry** (`billingON.jsp`) — interactive claim creation tied to a
  demographic and (optionally) an appointment, including service-code lookup,
  diagnostic code, and referral-doctor selection.
- **Bill review** (`billingONReview.jsp`) — per-bill review of items before
  save, including dx-code persistence and total recomputation.
- **Bill correction** (`billingONCorrection.jsp`) — full lifecycle edits on
  an already-saved bill: status changes, item edits, third-party payment
  entry, audit-snapshot writes to `billing_on_repo`.
- **Bill status** (`billingONStatus.jsp`) — paginated, filtered list of all
  bills with sort/search.
- **Disk creation + MOH submission** (the OHIP claim-file generators) —
  assemble batches, write the MOH HL7 / fixed-
  width file format, track disk IDs.
- **Remittance advice import** — pull MOH RA messages, settle headers,
  reconcile payments and rejects.
- **Service-code admin** — manage the `billing_service` table, including the
  underscore-prefixed "private" billing codes.

Provincial scope: **Ontario only**. The British Columbia analogue lives in
`billings/ca/bc` and is intentionally out of scope for this document. The
shared cross-province billing entry router lives at `billings/ca/pageUtil`
(see §4 below).

### 2.1 Java identifier abbreviations

Class and member names use Java-style acronym casing:

| Official/domain term | Identifier form | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Ontario / ON | `On` | `ViewBillingOn2Action` |
| OHIP | `Ohip` | `OhipClaimFileService` |
| RA / remittance advice | `Ra` | `BillingOnRaService` |
| MOH | `Moh` | `MoveMohFiles2Action` |
| INR | `Inr` | `InrBillingUpdate2Action` |
| GST | `Gst` | `GstSettingsService` (shared CA service) |
| MRI | `Mri` | `BillingOnMriViewModel` |
| EDT / OBEC | `Edt`, `Obec` | `BillingEdtObecOutputSpecificationParser` |
| diagnosis | `Diag` | `BillingOnReviewDiagPersister` |

This casing rule applies to Java identifiers only. Prose, JSP labels, external
protocol names, and Ministry/OHIP document references may keep official forms
such as `OHIP`, `RA`, and `MOH`. Avoid legacy compressed names (`3rd`, `Dig`,
`Db`, `Obj`, `Hlp`, `Bean`, `Handler`) and spell out normal domain words such
as `ThirdParty`, `Specialist`, `Payment`, `Address`, and `Report`.

## 3 — Architecture

The module is organised in three layers, top to bottom:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ HTTP boundary (Struts 7.1.1)                                         │

│   (web/)                       single-method per HTTP verb           │
└──────────────────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┘
                                       │

```

### 3.1 Suffix grammar (the layer-naming policy applied)

Every class in the module obeys the project-wide policy in
[`docs/architecture/layer-names.md`](architecture/layer-names.md). The
shortest version: pick the most specific role-suffix; fall back to `*Service`
only when nothing more specific applies.

| Role | Suffix | Examples in this module |
|---|---|---|
| HTTP entry point | `*2Action` | `BillingOnSave2Action`, `ViewBillingOnReview2Action` |
| View-model builder | `*ViewModelAssembler` | `BillingOnFormViewModelAssembler`, `BillingOnCorrectionViewModelAssembler` |
| Immutable presentation DTO | `*ViewModel` | `BillingOnFormViewModel`, `BillingOnStatusViewModel` |
| Typed write/validation input | `*Command` | `BillingCorrectionSubmitCommand`, `BillingSpecialistClaimCommand` |
| Persistence/query transfer DTO | `*Dto` | `BillingClaimHeaderDto`, `BillingClaimItemDto` |
| Sub-assembler / partial composer | `*RenderComposer` | `BillingOnCorrectionRenderComposer` |
| Pure-read query service | `*Loader` | `BillingOnClaimLoader`, `BillingOnDiskLoader`, `ServiceCodeLoader` |
| Pure-write persistence service | `*Persister` | `BillingOnClaimPersister`, `BillingOnReviewDiagPersister`, `DiagCodeDescriptionPersister`, `RaHeaderTotalsPersister`, `ServiceCodePersister` |
| Pure calculation | `*Calculator` | `BillingOnHistoryBalanceCalculator` (pure arithmetic only; DAO-backed balance loading belongs in a `*Service` / `*Loader`.) |
| Input validator | `*Validator` | `BillingOnReviewValidator` for composable result objects; command/value coercers may use `BillingValidationException` for fail-fast write paths |
| Mixed read/write orchestration | `*Service` | `BillingCorrectionService`, `BillingOnHeaderCreationService`, `BillingOnLookupService` |
| Data access | `*Dao` | `BillingONCHeader1Dao`, `BillingONPaymentDao`, `BillingServiceDao` |

DAOs do **not** orchestrate other DAOs — cross-DAO operations live in a
service. Static-utility classes use a domain noun with no suffix and live
either at the top of `billings/ca/on/` (`BillingDates`, `BillingMoney`)
or, for module-internal helpers, under `support/` (`BillingDateOfBirths`,
`BillingDomIdTokens`).

Forbidden in new code (and currently absent from this module): `*Prep`,
`*Manager`, `*Helper`, `*Utils`, compound suffixes like `*ServiceManager` or
`*LoaderService`.

### 3.2 Spring wiring

- All non-DAO components are registered with `@org.springframework.stereotype.Service`.
- Constructor injection is used in the `service/` and `assembler/` layers.
  The `web/` (Struts2 action) layer still has legacy
  `SpringUtils.getBean(...)` compatibility shims. New 2Actions should prefer
  constructor injection where the Struts2 wiring permits; treat new field-init
  `getBean` calls as a regression.
- `@Lazy` is **not** used anywhere in `billings/ca/on`. It was carried
  forward from a long-since-resolved circular-dependency workaround and was
  stripped in 2026-04-27. If you reintroduce a real cycle, Spring will fail
  at boot — fix the cycle, don't paper over it with `@Lazy`.
- `@Transactional` (or `@Transactional(readOnly = true)`) is applied at the
  service layer, not on assemblers or actions. Assemblers and actions stay
  outside the transaction boundary and delegate to services for read/write
  units of work.

### 3.3 DTO compatibility policy

Ontario billing still has DAO, parser, and JSP contracts that consume mutable
bean-style DTOs. Those classes should stay boring at the boundary but strict
inside it:

- Fields stay `private`; callers use accessors so validation and normalization
  cannot be bypassed.
- Money-bearing DTO fields normalize through `BillingMoney` or `BigDecimal`
  as soon as the setter receives raw parser/DAO text. Legacy string getters
  may remain when fixed-width import code or JSPs still need them, but they
  should return normalized decimal text.
- Class JavaDoc should explain legacy field names, fixed-width report shapes,
  and compatibility behavior. Do not add mechanical JavaDoc to every trivial
  bean accessor.
- Immutable records/builders are preferred for new DTOs, but convert old beans
  only after the parser, DAO, and JSP callers are pinned by focused tests.

### 3.4 Design rationale

Three constraints drove the layered shape:

1. **JSPs as views, not controllers.** Older billing JSPs hand-loaded data
   via inline scriptlets calling `SpringUtils.getBean(SomeDao.class)`. Every
   such pattern in `billing/CA/ON/` has been replaced by a ViewModelAssembler +
   ViewModel chain so the JSP renders from `${model.xxx}` only. The recipe is
   in [`docs/JSP-REFACTORING-GUIDE.md`](JSP-REFACTORING-GUIDE.md).
2. **Single-purpose classes over catch-alls.** The legacy `BillingONService`
   grew to 30+ unrelated methods and was deleted; its responsibilities now
   live across `BillingOnClaimLoader`, `BillingOnClaimPersister`,
   `BillingOnInvoiceTotalsService`, and several others.
3. **Pure queries on the entity, cross-DAO work in services.** Pure-state
   checks (`isOhipBill`, `isPaidInFull`, `isActive`, `recomputeTotalFromItems`)
   sit on `BillingONCHeader1` and `BillingONItem`. Cross-DAO operations
   (`calculateBalanceOwing` needs both header and payments) sit in a
   service. This is "rich-domain partial DDD" — see §5.

## 4 — Cross-province routing

The struts mapping `name="billing"` is the public entry point for both BC
and ON billing flows. It dispatches via a **router → chain → setup**
pattern:

```
GET/POST /carlos/billing?billRegion=ON&demographic_no=…
  │
  ├─► Billing2Action (ca.pageUtil) ◄── tiny router, no province imports
  │     ├── _billing r privilege check
  │     ├── reads request param billRegion (falls back to billregion property)
  │     └── returns "ON" or "BC"
  │
  ├─► result name="ON"  type="chain"  →  billing/CA/ON/billingView
  │     └── ViewBillingOn2Action  →  /WEB-INF/jsp/billing/CA/ON/billingON.jsp
  │
  └─► result name="BC"  type="chain"  →  billing/CA/BC/billingSetup
        └── BillingBCSetup2Action   →  /WEB-INF/jsp/billing/CA/BC/billingBC.jsp
```

Why the router lives at `ca.pageUtil` and not `ca.bc.pageUtil`: the cross-
province decision must not have BC-specific imports. The dedicated BC
setup action carries the BC-only coupling (`BillingSessionBean`,
`BillingGuidelines`, `BillingCreateBilling2Form`), and the ON path chains
through its own `ViewBillingOn2Action`.

Region resolution rules (`Billing2Action.execute`):

1. If `billRegion` request parameter is present and non-empty, use it.
2. Otherwise, fall back to `CarlosProperties.getProperty("billregion")`.
3. Anything not equal to `"ON"` (including null) routes to BC. Historical
   behaviour: BC was the original deployment.

The router gracefully handles `CarlosProperties.getProperties()` returning
null (which can happen pre-config), defaulting to BC.

Privilege check: `_billing r`. Province-specific gates also enforce
`_billing r` or `_billing w` as appropriate; the router doesn't grant; it
funnels.

## 5 — Entity model

Three entities carry the bulk of Ontario billing state:

| Entity | Table | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `BillingONCHeader1` | `billing_on_cheader1` | One row per claim — provider, demographic, totals, status, dates |
| `BillingONItem` | `billing_on_item` | Line items per claim — service code, fee, dx code, status |
| `BillingONPayment` | `billing_on_payment` | Payment records (3rd party, OHIP RA settlement) |
| `BillingONExt` | `billing_on_ext` | Extension key/value rows attached to either claim or payment |

### 5.1 Domain methods (rich-domain partial)

Pure-state queries live on the entity, where they belong:

```java
// BillingONCHeader1
public boolean isOhipBill();              // payProgram == "HCP"
public boolean isSettled();                // status == SETTLED ("S")
public boolean isActive();                 // status != DELETED ("D")
public boolean isDeleted();                // status == DELETED
public void    markSettled();              // setStatus(SETTLED) — single home for settle-side effects
public boolean isPaidInFull(BigDecimal paidTotal);   // paidTotal.compareTo(total) >= 0
public Optional<BigDecimal> recomputeTotalFromItems();  // sum of active items' fees

// BillingONItem
public boolean isActive();
public boolean isDeleted();
```

These methods reason about the entity's own fields only — no DAO calls,
no cross-aggregate state. They are unit-tested at
`src/test/java/io/github/carlos_emr/carlos/commn/model/BillingONCHeader1UnitTest.java`.

### 5.2 Setter invariants

`BillingONCHeader1.setTotal` enforces that invoice totals are non-negative
(refunds belong on the payments table). A negative argument indicates a
calling-side bug or corrupt import data, so the setter fails fast with
`IllegalArgumentException` rather than silently changing the amount.

The invariant is bypassable via field-level access (Hibernate load,
direct constructors), so it is not a structural guarantee on every read.
Import flows that need tolerant normalization must do that before calling
the entity setter. See the JavaDoc on `BillingONCHeader1.setTotal` for the
full contract; the unit test that pins it is
`BillingONCHeader1UnitTest.shouldRejectNegativeValues`.

Other setters are unchanged from the legacy shape and accept any input
(including null) — invariant tightening is incremental and only added
when a real bug history justifies it.

### 5.3 Soft-delete convention

`status = "D"` is the soft-delete marker for both `BillingONCHeader1` and
`BillingONItem`. **Never check the literal `"D"` in callers** — use
`entity.isActive()` / `entity.isDeleted()`. Callers that need filtered
lists use `BillingONCHeader1Dao.findActiveItems(invoiceNo)` (which queries
`BillingONItem` directly, not via the parent collection — see §6).

`status` values you'll see in the data:
- `null` or empty — open / unsubmitted
- `"O"` — open / billable
- `"S"` — settled (per RA import)
- `"D"` — soft-deleted
- Other codes (`"N"`, `"R"`, …) appear in correction workflows; treat them
  as opaque unless the specific value is what you care about.

### 5.4 Cross-aggregate calculations

Calculations that need data beyond a single entity live in a service:

```java
// service/BillingOnInvoiceTotalsService
public BigDecimal calculateBalanceOwing(Integer invoiceNo);
//   total - paidTotal + refundTotal, where paid/refund come from
//   BillingONPaymentDao.find3rdPartyPayRecordsByBill(header).
```

This stays in a service because it joins two aggregates (claim + payments).
The single-aggregate sum-of-items recompute lives on the entity as
`recomputeTotalFromItems()`.

## 6 — Hibernate fetch policy

Two `@OneToMany` collections were `FetchType.EAGER` historically and have
been flipped to `LAZY`:

- `BillingONCHeader1.billingItems`
- `BillingONPayment.billingONExtItems`

EAGER loading meant every header lookup paid for the items join, even when
the caller only wanted header scalars (status updates, totals, payments).
With LAZY:

### 6.1 Use the right find method

| Need | DAO method | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Header only | `BillingONCHeader1Dao.find(id)` | scalar-only paths, status updates, persistence |
| Header + items, single bill | `BillingONCHeader1Dao.findWithItems(id)` | renders, correction loads — JOIN FETCH for one query |
| Headers + items, demographic-scoped | `BillingONCHeader1Dao.findByDemoNoWithItems(demoNo, off, size)` | REST `BillingDetailConverter`, history pages — JOIN FETCH per row |
| Just the active items for a bill | `BillingONCHeader1Dao.findActiveItems(invoiceNo)` | direct JPQL on `BillingONItem` — bypasses the parent collection |

If you call `find(...)` and then access `.getBillingItems()` outside an
open Hibernate session (e.g., in a non-`@Transactional` assembler or a
REST converter), Hibernate throws `LazyInitializationException`. Use
`findWithItems` instead.

### 6.2 The pagination-safe DISTINCT pattern in `findByDemoNoWithItems`

```java
"SELECT h.id FROM BillingONCHeader1 h "
+ "WHERE h.demographicNo = ?1 AND h.status != 'D' "
+ "ORDER BY h.billingDate DESC, h.billingTime DESC, h.id DESC"
// setFirstResult(offset), setMaxResults(pageSize)

"SELECT DISTINCT h FROM BillingONCHeader1 h "
+ "LEFT JOIN FETCH h.billingItems "
+ "WHERE h.id IN :ids"
// sort the fetched headers back into id-query order
```

Pagination happens on a header-id query first. The second query fetches only
that page of headers with their items using `LEFT JOIN FETCH`. This avoids
Hibernate paging over the multiplied join rows. `DISTINCT` is still required
on the fetch query because `LEFT JOIN FETCH` produces one SQL row per child
item; the final in-memory sort restores the original id-query order.

### 6.3 Tested invariants

`src/test/java/io/github/carlos_emr/carlos/commn/dao/BillingONCHeader1DaoIntegrationTest.java`
contains nested classes `FindWithItems` and `FindByDemoNoWithItems` that
lock in the JOIN FETCH behaviour against H2. They use
`entityManager.clear()` after persisting test data to prove that the
returned entity's collection survives session detachment.

### 7.1 When to add which type

- **Adding a pure-read query?** Add a method to an existing `*Loader`, or
  create a new one if the surface doesn't fit. Annotate with
  `@Transactional(readOnly = true)`.
- **Adding a pure-write?** Add to an existing `*Persister`, or create a new
  one. Annotate with `@Transactional`.
- **Adding pure arithmetic?** First check if it fits on the entity (rich-
  domain). If it needs cross-aggregate state but no DAO writes and no
  cross-DAO reads, create or reuse a `*Calculator` such as
  `BillingOnHistoryBalanceCalculator`. If it does cross DAOs, fall back to
  `*Service`.
- **Adding a multi-step lifecycle?** That's a `*Service` — put it on the
  most relevant existing one if it's small, else create a new service.

Avoid creating a new `*Service` whenever a more specific suffix fits. The
goal is for the suffix to advertise the role.

## 8 — Web layer (Struts 7.1.1)

Every billing entry point is a `*2Action` extending `org.apache.struts2
.ActionSupport`. The ON actions in `web/` follow a
consistent shape:

`ViewBillingOnReview2Action` is the canonical shape — the example below is the
real source, lightly trimmed (see `web/ViewBillingOnReview2Action.java`):

```java
public class ViewBillingOnReview2Action extends ActionSupport {

    private final SecurityInfoManager securityInfoManager;
    private final BillingOnReviewDiagPersister dxPersister;
    private final BillingOnReviewViewModelAssembler assembler;

    public ViewBillingOnReview2Action(SecurityInfoManager securityInfoManager,
                                       BillingOnReviewDiagPersister dxPersister,
                                       BillingOnReviewViewModelAssembler assembler) {
        this.securityInfoManager = securityInfoManager;
        this.dxPersister = dxPersister;
        this.assembler = assembler;
    }

    @Override
    public String execute() throws Exception {
        HttpServletRequest request = ServletActionContext.getRequest();
        HttpServletResponse response = ServletActionContext.getResponse();
        LoggedInInfo loggedInInfo = LoggedInInfo.getLoggedInInfoFromSession(request);
        if (loggedInInfo == null) {
            throw new SecurityException("missing session");
        }

        }
        if (!"POST".equalsIgnoreCase(request.getMethod())) {
            // RFC 7231 §6.5.5: 405 responses MUST include the Allow header.
            response.setHeader("Allow", "POST");
            response.sendError(HttpServletResponse.SC_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED);
            return NONE;
        }
        String userNo = loggedInInfo.getLoggedInProviderNo();
        if (userNo == null || userNo.isEmpty()) {
            throw new SecurityException("missing provider in session");
        }
        dxPersister.persistIfRequested(request, userNo);
        BillingOnReviewViewModel model = assembler.assemble(request, loggedInInfo);
        request.setAttribute("reviewModel", model);
        return SUCCESS;
    }

    public BillingOnReviewViewModel getReviewModel() { /* ... */ }
}
```

Notes on this template:

- Review2Action is **POST-only** because it triggers a clinical-write side
  effect (`BillingOnReviewDiagPersister`). Read-only actions
  (e.g., `ViewBillingOn2Action`) accept GET/HEAD/POST instead and emit
  `Allow: "GET, HEAD, POST"`.
- The null-session guard runs **before** `hasPrivilege` because
  `SecurityInfoManagerImpl.hasPrivilege` dereferences `loggedInInfo` and
  emits a noisy "Error checking privileges" stack-trace before returning
  false on null. Failing fast keeps the log signal clean.
- The 405 path uses `response.sendError(...)` (which commits the response)
  rather than `setStatus(...)` so framework dispatch stops cleanly.

### 8.1 Action conventions

- **One method per action.** Most multi-method "router" actions
  (`?method=...`) have been split into single-purpose actions over the
  course of this refactor. Don't add new method-dispatch actions; see the
  [remaining method-dispatch cleanup](#remaining-method-dispatch-cleanup)
  follow-up, tracked by
  [carlos-emr/carlos#1751](https://github.com/carlos-emr/carlos/issues/1751),
  for the known remainders.
- **Constructor injection.** No `field = SpringUtils.getBean(...)` shims.
  Legacy Struts-created routers that still need a no-arg constructor may keep
  the `SpringUtils.getBean(...)` lookup inside that constructor and expose a
  package-private test constructor.
- **Privilege check first.** `_billing r` for read, `_billing w` for write.
  Throw `SecurityException` (the global Struts exception mapping renders
  the access-denied page).
- **HTTP method gate.** Mutation actions reject non-POST with
  `405 Method Not Allowed` and an `Allow` response header. Read actions
  accept GET/HEAD/POST (the billing form self-posts on titlesearch).
  View actions that only forward to a render JSP (no side effect) accept
  any method; gating them with POST-only breaks the navigation link.
- **Throw or `return NONE`.** Never silently swallow validation failures.

### 8.2 Struts mapping

All Ontario billing action mappings live in
`src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/struts-billing.xml`. Conventions:

- All routes are extensionless (`struts.action.extension=""`).
- All views live under `/WEB-INF/jsp/billing/CA/ON/` — never expose JSPs
  directly.
- Read actions return `SUCCESS` to a JSP forward. Mutation actions either
  forward to a confirmation JSP or chain to a sibling read action's result
  (e.g., `<result name="closeReload" type="chain">...</result>`).
- Cross-province dispatch uses `type="chain"` (preserves request, session,
  and original query params; no extra HTTP hop).

### 8.3 CSRF & encoding

- All POST forms get a CSRF-TOKEN auto-injected by CSRFGuard 4.5
  (configured in `Owasp.CsrfGuard.properties`). AJAX `fetch()` calls must
  read the token from `input[name="CSRF-TOKEN"]` and set it as the
  `CSRF-TOKEN` header. Pages without a real `<form>` use the bootstrap
  fragment at `/WEB-INF/jspf/csrf-token.jspf` — see
  [`docs/csrf-protection-architecture.md`](csrf-protection-architecture.md).
- All user data rendered to the JSP must use the CARLOS null-safe
  encoder: `<carlos:encode value="${...}"/>` for HTML body,
  `${carlos:forJavaScript(...)}` for JS strings, etc. CI fails the build
  if new code uses the unsafe `<e:forXxx>` / `${e:forXxx()}` /
  `Encode.forXxx(...)` forms — those return the literal string `"null"`
  for null inputs.

## 9 — Presentation layer (ViewModelAssembler + ViewModel)

Each JSP-backed page has exactly one ViewModelAssembler and one ViewModel:

```
ViewBillingOnReview2Action          ← gate
  └─► BillingOnReviewViewModelAssembler  ← composes data
        └─► BillingOnReviewViewModel ← immutable record consumed by the JSP
              └─► billingONReview.jsp
```

### 9.1 ViewModel conventions

- Java `record` (or a Lombok `@Builder` for nested-collection cases).
- All fields immutable. Lists are unmodifiable.
- Includes a `builder()` for ergonomic construction in the assembler.
- Fields named for their JSP-rendered shape (e.g., `formattedTotal`, not
  `total`). The view does no formatting — it just displays.

### 9.2 ViewModelAssembler conventions

- `@Service` Spring bean, constructor-injected dependencies.
- Single public method: `ViewModel assemble(HttpServletRequest, LoggedInInfo)`
  (or a more specific signature if the assembler needs domain inputs).
- No HTTP semantics — never returns an HTTP status code. If the request
  is malformed, the assembler fails fast with a typed exception or
  populates a per-field error flag on the view model. The action layer
  decides what HTTP code to send.
- No DAO writes. If the page submission triggers a write, the action
  delegates to a service (e.g., `BillingCorrectionService.updateInvoice`)
  before calling the assembler to render the post-write view.

### 9.2.1 Partial-load signalling — `partial` flag vs `LOAD_FAILURE_MARKER`

Two patterns coexist for "the loader caught an exception mid-iteration and
the result is incomplete":

- **`partial` flag on the ViewModel** (preferred): a `boolean partial` field
  on the immutable view model, set by the assembler in its catch branch.
  The JSP renders a "data may be incomplete" banner via
  `<c:if test="${model.partial}">…</c:if>`. Type-safe, out-of-band, no
  pollution of the row stream, count-correct.
- **`LOAD_FAILURE_MARKER` sentinel row** (legacy): a sentinel `Properties`
  row appended to the returned `List` with the marker key set to `"true"`.
  Callers must filter the marker before iterating and bump a partial flag
  themselves. Used in `BillingOnRaService.getRASummary` and
  `getRAErrorReport` because their return type is `List<Properties>` with
  no view-model layer of their own.

**When introducing a viewmodel for a path that currently uses
`LOAD_FAILURE_MARKER`, migrate to a `partial` flag.** Do not add new
`LOAD_FAILURE_MARKER` sites; the sentinel is a transitional shape.

### 9.2.2 Ontario billing documentation standard

Documentation-only passes in this module should be comment-only changes: no
behavioral rewrites hidden inside a comment sweep.

- `assembler`: class-level Javadoc, public entrypoint Javadoc, and targeted
  section comments where request normalization, precedence chains, or
  partial-load behavior would otherwise be opaque.
- `command`: record/class-level docs describing accepted legacy inputs,
  normalization rules, and validation semantics; helper methods are documented
  only when they encode non-obvious parsing contracts.
- `dto`: carrier types get class-level contract docs; method-level Javadoc is
  reserved for behavioral conversion helpers such as JSP map serialization or
  request-token parsing.
- root/support helpers: document null/blank/fallback/error semantics and any
  legacy formatting assumptions. Do not add mechanical comments to trivial
  getters, setters, or tiny private helpers.

Inline comments in billing-on code should explain the why: ministry file
offsets, PHI/security constraints, transaction boundaries, legacy JSP
compatibility, and invariants that a junior maintainer might otherwise infer
incorrectly from old names alone.

### 9.3 The JSP itself

After the refactor, every billing JSP under `WEB-INF/jsp/billing/CA/ON/`
should:

- Declare the `<%@ taglib uri="carlos" prefix="carlos" %>` taglib once.
- Render exclusively from `${model.xxx}` — no `<%= ... %>` scriptlets,
  no `SpringUtils.getBean(...)` calls, no `<%@page import>` of model
  classes.
- Use `<carlos:encode>` (or the corresponding EL function) for every
  user-data interpolation.

The largest remaining JSP, `billingON.jsp`, follows the same recipe as the
other fat ON JSPs (`billingONCorrection.jsp`, `billingONReview.jsp`,
`billingONStatus.jsp`, `billingShortcutPg1.jsp`): move data access into
services/loaders and render encoded view-model fields only.

The recipe itself is documented in
[`docs/JSP-REFACTORING-GUIDE.md`](JSP-REFACTORING-GUIDE.md).

## 10 — Adding a new feature (recipe)

Suppose you're adding a new "void claim" page. Follow this checklist:

1. **Database changes** (if any) go to `database/mysql/updates/update-YYYY-
   MM-DD-void-claim.sql`. Add the migration script; do not modify
   `oscarinit_2025.sql` directly.
2. **DAO method**, if a new query is needed. Add to the relevant
   `*Dao.java` interface and `*DaoImpl.java`. Use parameterised JPQL.
   Cover with a `*DaoIntegrationTest`.
3. **Service / Loader / Persister method.**
   - Pure read? → `*Loader`.
   - Pure write? → `*Persister`.
   - Multi-step → `*Service` (annotate with `@Transactional`).
   - Use the entity's own domain methods where applicable.
4. **ViewModel** under `viewmodel/` — immutable record, constructed via
   builder. Field names match the JSP's render needs.
5. **ViewModelAssembler** under `assembler/` — `@Service`, constructor-injected,
   single `assemble(...)` method.
6. **Action** under `web/` — `*2Action` extending `ActionSupport`. Privilege
   check, HTTP method gate, delegate to assembler/service, set
   `request.setAttribute("model", vm)`, return result string.
7. **Struts mapping** in `struts-billing.xml`. Choose the convention that
   matches similar actions; prefer extensionless routes.
8. **JSP** under `/WEB-INF/jsp/billing/CA/ON/`. Render from `${model.*}`
   only. Encode all output via `<carlos:encode>`.
9. **Tests:**
   - DAO method → `*DaoIntegrationTest` (extends `CarlosTestBase`,
     tagged `@Tag("integration") @Tag("dao") @Tag("billing")`).
   - Service method → unit test extending `CarlosUnitTestBase`, mock the
     DAO. Or integration test if real persistence behaviour matters.
   - ViewModelAssembler → unit test mocking the loaders/services it consumes.
   - Action → unit test asserting the privilege check, the method gate,
     and the success delegation pattern.
10. **Wire to navigation.** Add the link in the appropriate JSP nav
    fragment. Don't link to the JSP — link to the action route.

### 10.1 Naming the class

Pick the suffix that best advertises the role (see §3.1). If you find
yourself reaching for "FooSomething" and it has both reads and writes,
ask: does this orchestrate a lifecycle, or is it just a misnamed grab
bag? A grab bag should be split.

## 11 — Testing patterns

The module has 200+ tests across unit and integration tiers. Tagging:

```bash
mvn test -Dgroups="billing"            # all billing tests
mvn test -Dgroups="billing,unit"       # billing unit tests only
mvn test -Dgroups="billing,integration"  # billing integration tests
```

### 11.1 Unit test base classes

- `CarlosUnitTestBase` — for tests that mock `SpringUtils.getBean(...)`.
  Provides `registerMock(Class, Object)`.
- `CarlosTestBase` — for tests that need a Spring context + H2 database.
  Provides `entityManager`, `hibernateTemplate`, transactional rollback.

For an `*Action` test that needs `ServletActionContext`, the pattern is:

```java
private MockedStatic<ServletActionContext> servletActionContextMock;
private MockedStatic<LoggedInInfo> loggedInInfoMock;

@BeforeEach
void setUp() {
    mockitoCloseable = MockitoAnnotations.openMocks(this);
    mockRequest = new MockHttpServletRequest();
    mockResponse = new MockHttpServletResponse();
    mockRequest.setMethod("POST");

    servletActionContextMock = mockStatic(ServletActionContext.class);
    servletActionContextMock.when(ServletActionContext::getRequest).thenReturn(mockRequest);
    servletActionContextMock.when(ServletActionContext::getResponse).thenReturn(mockResponse);

    loggedInInfoMock = mockStatic(LoggedInInfo.class);
    loggedInInfoMock.when(() -> LoggedInInfo.getLoggedInInfoFromSession(any(HttpServletRequest.class)))
            .thenReturn(mockLoggedInInfo);

    when(mockSecurityInfoManager.hasPrivilege(any(), eq("_billing"), eq("r"), isNull()))
            .thenReturn(true);
}

@AfterEach
void tearDown() throws Exception {
    if (loggedInInfoMock != null) loggedInInfoMock.close();
    if (servletActionContextMock != null) servletActionContextMock.close();
    if (mockitoCloseable != null) mockitoCloseable.close();
}
```

`Billing2ActionUnitTest` is a good template — it exercises the privilege
gate, the region-resolution matrix, and the null-safe `CarlosProperties`
fallback.

### 11.2 BDD naming

The convention is `should<Action>_<preposition><Condition>()` with one
underscore separator. Examples in this module:

```java
void shouldReturnON_whenBillRegionParamIsON()
void shouldReturnSuccess_whenAuthorizedGetWithoutMutationIntent()
void shouldThrowSecurityException_whenMissingBillingReadPrivilege()
void shouldReturn405WithAllowHeader_onUpload_whenGet()
```

### 11.3 Hibernate test traps

The `CarlosTestBase` integration tests share a JDBC connection across the
JPA `EntityManager` and the legacy Hibernate `Session`. Common pitfalls
(documented at length in CLAUDE.md):

- Use `hibernateTemplate.flush()` after a `HibernateDaoSupport`-based
  DAO write. `entityManager.flush()` only flushes the JPA context.
- HBM property names are case-sensitive — check the `.hbm.xml` before
  writing HQL.
- Always quote H2 reserved words in HBM column attributes
  (`column="`value`"`).
- `entityManager.clear()` before asserting on a freshly-loaded entity if
  you want to confirm true LAZY/JOIN-FETCH behaviour rather than first-
  level cache return.

## 12 — Open follow-ups

Things this module would benefit from but which are not yet done:

- **`billingON.jsp` JSP refactor (Phase 2A).**
  The largest remaining ON JSP is being decomposed into Assembler +
  ViewModel + JSP includes — same recipe as the four other ON billing
  JSPs that are already done.
- **BC parity.** This module structure has not been mirrored into
  `billings/ca/bc`. The BC analogue still has the legacy patterns
  (multi-method actions, scriptlet JSPs, mixed-role services). Out of
  scope for the ON refactor branch; tracked separately.
- **Uppercase ON package migration.** Some legacy `billing/CA/ON` DAO/model
  classes are still shared by the lowercase `billings/ca/on` module
  (`BillingONDiskName`, `BillingONFilename`, `EDTFolder`, etc.). Keep new
  module code in lowercase packages and migrate the shared legacy classes in a
  dedicated compatibility pass.
- **Mixed-role services.** A handful of pre-existing services
  (`BillingOnLookupService`, `BillingDiskCreationService`,
  `BillingClaimSubmissionService`, `BillingOnCorrectionPersister`) carry
  both reads and writes. They legitimately orchestrate mixed lifecycles
  today, but if any one of them grows further, splitting into
  `*Loader` + `*Persister` is the next step.
- **Service-grid query batching.** `BillingOnFormServiceGridComposer` still
  has documented `TODO(perf)` N+1 lookups while preserving the legacy billing
  form output. Track any optimizer pass as a separate performance issue with
  before/after query counts.
- **DTO modernization beyond compatibility.** The highest-risk legacy DTO
  fields are now private and normalize money at the setter boundary, but some
  classes intentionally remain mutable beans because DAO, parser, and JSP
  contracts still depend on that shape. Convert individual DTOs to records or
  builders only after their parser, DAO, and JSP callers are pinned by focused
  compatibility tests.
- **Presentation assembler coverage.** High-branching report assemblers
  should continue to receive focused unit tests as they are touched. Cover
  failure banners, partial-data flags, and money/date parsing before changing
  rendering behaviour.
- **Layer test tags.** The current test suite is mostly tagged `unit` and
  `billing`; module-specific tags such as `service`, `assembler`, `loader`,
  `persister`, `calculator`, and `action` should be added in a mechanical pass
  so filtered Maven runs match the documented architecture vocabulary.

<a id="remaining-method-dispatch-cleanup"></a>
- **Remaining method-dispatch cleanup.** Active method-param dispatch remains
  in `BatchBill2Action`, `ManageCss2Action`, and `BillingOnPayments2Action`.
  The correction routes `BillingCorrection2Action` and
  `UpdateBillingOnCorrection2Action` also retain legacy correction-flow
  compatibility and are tracked with
  [carlos-emr/carlos#1751](https://github.com/carlos-emr/carlos/issues/1751).
- **JSP guardrail.** `scripts/lint/check-jsp-size.sh` fails CI on any JSP
  under `WEB-INF/jsp/billing/**` that exceeds the byte/scriptlet/getBean
  thresholds. Cheap insurance against the page-buffer workaround returning.

## 14 — Refactor Rules

Keep this document focused on current module rules. Historical commit
references belong in Git history and PR descriptions, not in architecture
docs that future maintainers read as the source of truth.

- Prefer thin Struts actions that enforce HTTP method, privilege, and request
  binding before delegating to services.
- Keep write workflows inside explicit `*Service` or `*Persister`
  transactional boundaries.
- Keep JSPs rendering from view models, with all user-controlled values
  encoded at the rendering boundary.
