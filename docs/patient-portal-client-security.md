# Patient portal client security checks

The CARLOS client signs the authenticated provider, clinic, permissions, key ID,
and exact request. The portal verifies the signature and consumes its UUID nonce
before executing an internal operation. Patient access and privilege checks still
run in CARLOS before signing.

Configure `patient_portal.staff_assertion.key_id` to match an entry in the portal's
`PATIENT_PORTAL_INTERNAL_STAFF_ASSERTION_PUBLIC_KEYRING`. Deploy a new public key
in that ring before changing the CARLOS key ID and private key. Keep the old
public key until outstanding assertions have expired. The complete configuration
and rotation example is in `src/main/resources/carlos.properties`.

The request hash is SHA-256 over four components: uppercase ASCII method, raw
UTF-8 path, raw UTF-8 query (without `?`), and body bytes. Each component is prefixed
by its length as an eight-byte big-endian integer. CARLOS encodes Unicode URL
prefixes before signing and sends the same UTF-8 body bytes that it hashes.
Proxies must preserve the path, query, and body seen by the portal. Rewriting
these values invalidates authentication; do not enable legacy authentication
to work around a mismatch.

The transport allows four concurrent exchanges per client and has no request
queue. `patient_portal.timeout.request.ms` defaults to 20000 and must be positive
and below 60000. It bounds the caller's wait through connection establishment and
body reading, in addition to the connect/read inactivity timeouts. On expiration
or interruption, CARLOS cancels the underlying HTTP request. A worker that does
not respond to cancellation retains its slot until it actually exits, preventing
unbounded replacement threads. A timed-out mutation may already have applied;
check current state before retrying.

## Verification

Run the CARLOS regression suite:

```sh
mvn -Dtest='*Portal*UnitTest,MutatorActionGetRejectionContractUnitTest' test
```

`PortalStaffAssertionSignerUnitTest` compares Java's complete signed assertions
with `src/test/resources/patientportal/assertion-contract.json`. These vectors
use a public RFC 8032 test key and were generated against portal commit
`c8d558dbffdc1c8bf701884b91e7310d1c05150c`. They cover empty bodies, Unicode bodies,
encoded deployment paths, and query ordering/escaping. They contain no operational
credentials or patient data.

Using a Python environment with the corresponding `carlos-patient-portal` package
installed, check the same vectors with the portal's real verifier:

```sh
/path/to/portal-venv/bin/python scripts/check-patient-portal-assertion-contract.py
```

This check requires no running portal or network calls. It disables legacy
assertions, exercises modified method/patient/query/body rejection, keyring
overlap and retirement, expiration, and duplicate nonce rejection across two
database sessions using an in-memory SQLite database. It patches only the clock
to the fixture's timestamp. Run both suites when updating the fixture or either
side of the authentication contract.

`PortalRequestDeadlineUnitTest` exercises slow response cancellation, recovery,
excess-work rejection, interruption, and shutdown using real loopback sockets.
